                  <b>Abstract: </b>
                  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a real-time, non-invasive, nonionizing imaging modality with an
                  increasing popularity in clinical otology as it combines the advantages of structural imaging and
                  functional diagnostics of the middle ear space without disrupting the tympanic membrane at the
                  point-of-care. Middle ear OCT(ME-OCT) offers static structural imaging and Doppler vibrometry of the
                  ossicular chain, offering complementary information for clinical decisions. However, the existing
                  modalities limit the temporal perception of visualizing ME dynamics in vivo. We present a custom-built
                  OCT system which is capable of continuous 3D acquisition and visualization (4D OCT) of the ME and its
                  utility in clinical diagnosis where such improved modality provides objective visual documentation of
                  otologic examinations., i.e., Valsalva maneuver. We also show that such capabilities afford visual
                  aids in surgical exploration, i.e., partial ossicular prosthesis (PORP) and cochlear implant (CI)
                  surgeries.

                  Improved middle ear imaging with optical coherence tomography for clinical otology
                </h3>
                <p class="pub_author"><b>Author: </b> Junzhe Wang</p>
                <p class="pub_abstract">
                  <b>Abstract: </b>Conductive hearing loss (CHL) is a widespread and debilitating condition that affects
                  millions of individuals worldwide. This impairment results from disruptions in the transmission of
                  sound waves from the tympanic membrane (TM) to the inner ear. Unfortunately, existing diagnostic tools
                  are often inadequate in pinpointing the root causes of CHL, leading to uncertainty when determining
                  the most appropriate clinical management plans. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging
                  imaging modality that offers non-invasive, high-resolution structural images of the middle ear. It
                  also allows for measuring vibrations in middle ear structures in response to sound through an intact
                  TM. Like all biomedical imaging methods, middle ear OCT (ME-OCT) aims to extract diagnostically
                  significant information from the acquired images. However, its clinical application is limited by
                  suboptimal image quality, due in large part to sidelobe artefacts and the effective imaging depth in
                  the presence of optically opaque structures, such as cartilage tympanoplasty. This thesis introduces
                  two approaches to improve middle ear visualisation using OCT without modifying the existing imaging
                  system. First, it presents a method that employs a convolutional basis pursuit framework to eliminate
                  imaging artefacts related to strong reflections at tissue-air interfaces, which impede accurate
                  morphology-based diagnoses. Second, it explores the potential of an optical clearing agent using a
                  topical glycerol treatment to increase the transparency of cartilage grafts, allowing for OCT
                  visualisation of the post-operative middle ear. The enhanced image quality could facilitate more
                  precise CHL diagnoses based on morphological changes of middle structures, providing clinicians with
                  more accurate and reliable diagnostics using ME-OCT.

                  <b>Abstract: </b>We introduce a novel system for geometrically accurate, continuous, live, volumetric
                  middle ear optical coherence tomography imaging over a 10.9 mm × 30° × 30° field of view (FOV) from a
                  handheld imaging probe. The system employs a discretized spiral scanning (DC-SC) pattern to rapidly
                  collect volumetric data and applies real-time scan conversion and lateral angular distortion
                  correction to reduce geometric inaccuracies to below the system’s lateral resolution over 92% of the
                  FOV. We validate the geometric accuracy of the resulting images through comparison with co-registered
                  micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) volumes of a phantom target and a cadaveric middle ear. The
                  system’s real-time volumetric imaging capabilities are assessed by imaging the ear of a healthy
                  subject while performing dynamic pressurization of the middle ear in a Valsalva maneuver.

                  <b>Abstract: </b>This study investigated the use of transtympanic middle ear optical coherence
                  tomography (ME-OCT) in assessing the placement of cochlear implants (CIs) in situ. A 72-year-old man
                  with bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss due to noise exposure received a CI in his right
                  ear and was evaluated three months later. A custom-built swept source ME-OCT system was utilized for
                  imaging, capturing two- and three-dimensional images of the patient's CI. Additionally, transtympanic
                  OCT imaging was performed on a human cadaveric temporal bone to visualize the insertion and removal of
                  a similar CI. The images and videos were analyzed to evaluate the visibility of implant features and
                  to quantify the insertion depth of the CI. Both in the patient and the cadaveric temporal bone, the CI
                  electrode was clearly visible in the round window niche, and its characteristic design features
                  enabled quantification of insertion depth. The study concludes that ME-OCT could serve as a
                  noninvasive and nonionizing method in clinical settings to confirm CI placement and measure insertion
                  depth, demonstrating its potential utility in postoperative ear assessments.

                  <b>Abstract: </b>In this study, we explored the potential of optical clearing agents (OCAs) for
                  rendering cartilage tympanoplasty grafts transparent enough to visualize middle ear structures using
                  optical coherence tomography (OCT). The experiment involved treating human tragal cartilage with
                  glycerol, a common OCA, and measuring the optical attenuation and dimensional changes of the graft as
                  it cleared. This was followed by a separate experiment using a human cadaveric temporal bone prepared
                  to simulate an ossiculoplasty surgery with a cartilage replacement of the tympanic membrane and a
                  partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP). The results showed a significant decrease in the
                  optical attenuation of 0.4mm cartilage grafts treated with glycerol, with the effects being reversible
                  after saline washout. In the temporal bone experiment, glycerol treatment of the cartilage graft led
                  to substantial increases in signal-to-noise ratio and contrast, enhancing the visualization of the
                  PORP through the graft using OCT. These findings suggest that OCAs could be a valuable tool in OCT
                  imaging of post-surgical ears with cartilage grafts.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> In this study, we demonstrate a sparsity-regularized, complex, blind deconvolution
                  method for removing sidelobe artefacts and stochastic noise from optical coherence tomography (OCT)
                  images. Our method estimates the complex scattering amplitude of tissue on a line-by-line basis by
                  estimating and deconvolving the complex, one-dimensional axial point spread function (PSF) from
                  measured OCT A-line data. We also present a strategy for employing a sparsity weighting mask to
                  mitigate the loss of speckle brightness within tissue-containing regions caused by the sparse
                  deconvolution. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that this approach suppresses sidelobe
                  artefacts and background noise better than traditional spectral reshaping techniques, with negligible
                  loss of tissue structure. The technique is particularly useful for emerging OCT applications where OCT
                  images contain strong specular reflections at air-tissue boundaries that create large sidelobe
                  artefacts.
