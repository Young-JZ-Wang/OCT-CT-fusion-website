        Technical realization of ME-OCT
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Emerging imgaging technology for hearing diagnostics</h2>
      <p class="paragraph" id ="fisrtWord">
        Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a significant advancement in otology and auditory physiology, 
        offering complementary information for clinical decision-making in the examination of the tympanic membrane (TM), 
        ossicular chain, and inner ear. 
        This non-invasive, depth-resolved imaging technique for hearing diagnostics has many advantages over traditional otoscopes and surgical microscopes, 
        which are the primary tools for otologic point of care imaging. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pitris et al. first demonstrated the potential of OCT imaging for the TM and middle ear in 2001. 
        However, widespread interest in OCT technology for otology research and clinical applications took nearly a decade to develop due to technological limitations. 
        The introduction of swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) in the 2010s, 
        featuring akinetic all-semiconductor lasers and other highly phase-stable systems, 
        made real-time in-vivo middle ear OCT clinically viable.

      ME-OCT has since been applied to various clinical applications, 
      such as detecting cholesteatomas, guiding ear surgery, 
      measuring TM thickness, grading otitis media, 
      evaluating tympanoplasty success, 
      and discriminating presumptive otosclerosis from healthy controls. 
      Notably, OCT has shown potential to improve otitis media (OM) diagnosis by detecting biofilm presence behind the TM, 
      resulting in higher diagnostic sensitivity (83% vs. 74%) and specificity (98% vs. 60%) compared to standard otoscopy. 
      In a study conducted with a pediatric population, 
      OCT showed compelling diagnostic accuracy in detecting effusion in the middle ear space, 
      exhibiting high diagnostic accuracy of 90.6%, sensitivity of 90.9%, and specificity of 90.2%. 
      This improvement has the potential to optimise clinical workflow in comparison to traditional methods, 
      such as pneumatic otoscopy, which often necessitates sealing the ear canal.

    <p class="paragraph">
      To accelerate the clinical adoption of OCT in otology, 
      several form factors have been explored to address the diverse clinical needs. 
      For example, integrating OCT with surgical microscopes has enabled detection of microanatomic changes in TM layers and differentiation of keratin from normal or inflamed middle ear mucosa. 
      Handheld OCT probes, resembling otoscopes or endoscopes, 
      have demonstrated their ability to detect biofilm behind the TM and to identify ossicular fixations. 
      Here you can see the pathway our lab took to bring middle ear OCT system from a benchtop design to a practical clinical solution for ENTs.
      We developed a handheld, otoscopic form factor that is already familiar to clinicians. 
      This system comprises a desktop console, a tethered hand-piece, 
      and an intuitive user interface. It is designed for single-operator use, 
      allowing for direct patient interaction and simultaneous measurement initiation.
