        Technical realization of ME-OCT
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">A promising modality for otology</h2>
      <p class="paragraph" id ="fisrtWord">
        Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a significant advancement in otology and auditory physiology, 
        offering complementary information for clinical decision-making in the examination of the tympanic membrane (TM), 
        ossicular chain, and inner ear. 
        This non-invasive, depth-resolved imaging technique for hearing diagnostics has many advantages over traditional otoscopes and surgical microscopes, 
        which are the primary tools for otologic point of care imaging. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pitris et al. first demonstrated the potential of OCT imaging for the TM and middle ear in 2001. 
        However, widespread interest in OCT technology for otology research and clinical applications took nearly a decade to develop due to technological limitations. 
        The introduction of swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) in the 2010s, 
        featuring akinetic all-semiconductor lasers and other highly phase-stable systems, 
        made real-time in-vivo middle ear OCT clinically viable.

      ME-OCT has since been applied to various clinical applications, 
      such as detecting cholesteatomas, guiding ear surgery, 
      measuring TM thickness, grading otitis media, 
      evaluating tympanoplasty success, 
      and discriminating presumptive otosclerosis from healthy controls. 
      Notably, OCT has shown potential to improve otitis media (OM) diagnosis by detecting biofilm presence behind the TM, 
      resulting in higher diagnostic sensitivity (83% vs. 74%) and specificity (98% vs. 60%) compared to standard otoscopy. 
      In a study conducted with a pediatric population, 
      OCT showed compelling diagnostic accuracy in detecting effusion in the middle ear space, 
      exhibiting high diagnostic accuracy of 90.6%, sensitivity of 90.9%, and specificity of 90.2%. 
      This improvement has the potential to optimise clinical workflow in comparison to traditional methods, 
      such as pneumatic otoscopy, which often necessitates sealing the ear canal.

        In TD-OCT, light is emitted from a broadband source, 
        such as a superluminescent diode (SLEDs). 
        The characteristics of the light determine one key OCT performance metric: the axial resolution, 
        \(\Delta z\), or coherence length, \(l_c\). 
        Assuming that the spectral distribution of SLEDs is Gaussian, the axial resolution is given by:</p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">\( \Delta z = \frac{l_c}{2} = \frac{2 \ln 2}{\pi} \cdot \frac{{\lambda_o}^2}{\Delta \lambda} \)</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      where \( \lambda_o \) is the center wavelength, and \( \Delta\lambda \) is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral bandwidth. 
      As the axial resolution is inversely proportional to the spectral bandwidth, 
      a broadband source is preferred to achieve a higher axial resolution. 
      In OCT, the lateral resolution is decoupled from the axial resolution and is governed by its optical design. 
      The lateral resolution is inversely proportional to the numerical aperture (NA):
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">\( \Delta y = 1.27 \frac{{\lambda_o}}{NA} \)</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Although TD-OCT is simple to construct and offers a long-depth scan range, 
      TD-OCT suffers from slow imaging acquisition speed and an unfavourable trade-off between imaging depth, 
      imaging acquisition speed, and sensitivity.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title_h1">
      Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT)
    </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Principle idea of FD-OCT</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      An alternative solution to TD-OCT is Fourier domain OCT (FD-OCT),
       which is used in most modern OCT systems owing to superior acquisition speed and sensitivity.
       In TD-OCT, axial detection is performed sequentially through the mechanical translation of the reference mirror whereas FD-OCT samples all axial depths simultaneously, 
       enabling high sensitivity and fast acquisition. In FD-OCT, a spectral interferogram signal is generated by performing a spectrally resolved measurement of the interference intensity between the light reflected from the sample and light from a fixed reference arm,
      as shown in here. The frequency of the cosine term in the interferometric signal, seen in the equation below:
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">  \( I(k) = G(k) \left( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha(z) \cos(2knz) \, dz \right) \)</p>
    <p class="paragraph">
    is proportional to the relative path length difference between the reflector in the reference arm and the sample arm. 
    Meanwhile, the amplitude of the interferometric signal encodes information about the sample reflectivity. 
    As reflected light from all axial depths in the sample is captured and modulated in the source spectrum, 
    all the spectral components are captured simultaneously which leads to faster acquisition speed and higher sensitivity as compared to TD-OCT.
